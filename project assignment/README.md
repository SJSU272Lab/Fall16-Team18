Abstract

Hiking on weekend or other outdoor activities are attractive for most people. However, it is difficult for people to find a good place in their spare time, especially those new residence. Besides Yelp, which allows us to get the information for restaurants nearby, and google map, which can guide us to the destination, there is not any other applications to provide us some good places nearby, such as hiking, fishing or so on.

Our project is aiming to solve this problem, we develop a platform for both individual guides and tourists. Individual guide can create a destination depends on their choices where they want to offer services. Our platform provides plenty of information like pictures by using APIs for individual guides to fetch when creating their web pages. On the touristsâ€™ side, tourists can search for web pages created by individual guides and then reserve a spot by paying with a credit card. Our platform can be divided as three parts, such as servers, client and database. We develop RESTful services by using Node.js (Express JS), client side by using AngularJS and HTML5 and database to store data by using MySQL.
